Three selection scan analyses are applied:
1. Raised Accuracy in Sweep Detection (RAiSD; Alachiotis and Pavlidis 2018)
2. Cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XP-CLR; Chen et al. 2010)
3. Population branch statistics for four populations (PBS; Jiang and Assis 2020)

For XP-CLR, one example for scaffold 1 is provided.
For PBS, both the R script and the bash files are needed.
